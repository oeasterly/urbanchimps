Training Philosophy
My philosophy towards physical training is grounded in functional movement that delves into mobility, balance, flexibility, core conditioning, orchestration of complex muscle synchronicity, functional strength and peak dynamic movement. All of this is coached through a comprehensive set of fun and always evolving activities. Additional benefits include preventing injuries, weight management, increasing daily energy, better sleeping patterns and much more.
